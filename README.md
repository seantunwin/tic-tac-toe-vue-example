# tic-tac-toe-vue-example

A minimal, low‑impact example of Tic‑Tac‑Toe implemented with Vue 3 with TypeScript. Intended as a small learning project and reference for basic component structure, reactivity, and simple state management.

## Features
- Single-page Tic‑Tac‑Toe game (two players, local)
- Built with Vue 3 (Composition API compatible) and TypeScript
- Small, easy-to-read codebase for learning

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (20+ recommended)
- npm or yarn

## Quick start
1. Install dependencies
  - npm: `npm install`
  - yarn: `yarn`
2. Run the dev server

The production build will be output to the configured `dist` directory.
